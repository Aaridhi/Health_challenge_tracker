🚀 Features & Implementation
1️⃣ Adding Workouts
✅ Users enter name, workout type, and duration in the form.
✅ Data is validated and stored in localStorage.
✅ The form resets after submission.

📍 Code: workout-form.component.ts

typescript
Copy
Edit
addWorkout() {
  if (this.userName && this.workoutType && this.workoutMinutes > 0) {
    this.workoutService.addWorkout(this.userName, this.workoutType, this.workoutMinutes);
    this.resetForm();
  }
}
2️⃣ Displaying Workouts in a Table
✅ Table grid displays users, workouts, workout count, and total minutes.
✅ Implements search and filter options.
✅ Supports pagination for large datasets.

📍 Code: workout-list.component.ts

typescript
Copy
Edit
filterWorkouts(): UserWorkout[] {
  let filtered = this.workoutService.getWorkouts();

  if (this.searchQuery) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(u => u.name.toLowerCase().includes(this.searchQuery.toLowerCase()));
  }

  if (this.filterType !== 'All') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(u => u.workouts.some(w => w.type === this.filterType));
  }

  return filtered.slice((this.currentPage - 1) * this.itemsPerPage, this.currentPage * this.itemsPerPage);
}
3️⃣ Storing Data in LocalStorage
✅ Saves user workouts persistently across sessions.
✅ Loads existing users and workouts on page refresh.

📍 Code: workout.service.ts

typescript
Copy
Edit
private saveWorkouts() {
  localStorage.setItem(this.storageKey, JSON.stringify(this.workouts));
}
4️⃣ Visualizing Progress with Charts
✅ Displays workout progress per user in a bar chart.
✅ Uses ngx-charts for dynamic visualization.

📍 Code: workout-chart.component.ts

typescript
Copy
Edit
this.chartData = selectedUser.workouts.map(w => ({
  name: w.type,
  value: w.minutes
}));
5️⃣ Pagination
✅ Users can navigate pages if more than 5 users exist.

📍 Code: workout-list.component.ts

typescript
Copy
Edit
nextPage() {
  if (this.currentPage * this.itemsPerPage < this.workoutService.getWorkouts().length) {
    this.currentPage++;
  }
}
